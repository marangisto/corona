If this bit is set, the TRIM bits are read-only. The TRIM value can be adjusted by hardware by one or two steps at a time, depending on the measured frequency error value. Refer to Section7.3.4: Frequency error evaluation and automatic trimming for more details.

They can be programmed to adjust to variations in voltage and temperature that influence the frequency of the HSI48. The default value is 32, which corresponds to the middle of the trimming interval. The trimming step is around 67 kHz between two consecutive TRIM steps. A higher TRIM value corresponds to a higher output frequency. When the AUTOTRIMEN bit is set, this field is controlled by hardware and is read-only.

Note: When using USB LPM (Link Power Management) and the device is in Sleep mode, the periodic USB SOF will not be generated by the host. No SYNC signal will therefore be provided to the CRS to calibrate the HSI48 on the run. To guarantee the required clock precision after waking up from Sleep mode, the LSE or reference clock on the GPIOs should be used as SYNC signal.

This means that either no adjustment of the TRIM value is needed or that an adjustment by one trimming step is enough to compensate the frequency error. An interrupt is generated if the SYNCOKIE bit is set in the CRS_CR register. It is cleared by software by setting the SYNCOKC bit in the CRS_ICR register.

This means that to compensate the frequency error, the TRIM value must be adjusted by two steps or more. An interrupt is generated if the SYNCWARNIE bit is set in the CRS_CR register. It is cleared by software by setting the SYNCWARNC bit in the CRS_ICR register.
    static constexpr uint32_t ISR_ERRF = 0x4; // Error flag This flag is set by hardware in case of any synchronization or trimming error. It is the logical OR of the TRIMOVF, SYNCMISS and SYNCERR bits. An interrupt is generated if the ERRIE bit is set in the CRS_CR register. It is cleared by software in reaction to setting the ERRC bit in the CRS_ICR register, which clears the TRIMOVF, SYNCMISS and SYNCERR bits.

This means that the frequency error is too big (internal frequency too low) to be compensated by adjusting the TRIM value, and that some other action should be taken. An interrupt is generated if the ERRIE bit is set in the CRS_CR register. It is cleared by software by setting the ERRC bit in the CRS_ICR register.

At this point, the frequency error counter is stopped (waiting for a next SYNC) and an interrupt is generated if the ERRIE bit is set in the CRS_CR register. It is cleared by software by setting the ERRC bit in the CRS_ICR register.
    static constexpr uint32_t ISR_TRIMOVF = 0x400; // Trimming overflow or underflow This flag is set by hardware when the automatic trimming tries to over- or under-flow the TRIM value. An interrupt is generated if the ERRIE bit is set in the CRS_CR register. It is cleared by software by setting the ERRC bit in the CRS_ICR register.
