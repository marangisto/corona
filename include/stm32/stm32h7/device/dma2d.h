Once the transfer has started, they are read-only. The address alignment must match the image format selected e.g. a 32-bit per pixel format must be 32-bit aligned and a 16-bit per pixel format must be 16-bit aligned.

    static constexpr uint32_t OOR_RESET_VALUE = 0x0; // Reset value
    typedef bit_field_t<0, 0x3fff> OOR_LO; // Line Offset Line offset used for the output (expressed in pixels). This value is used for the address generation. It is added at the end of each line to determine the starting address of the next line. These bits can only be written when data transfers are disabled. Once the transfer has started, they are read-only.

    static constexpr uint32_t NLR_RESET_VALUE = 0x0; // Reset value
    typedef bit_field_t<0, 0xffff> NLR_NL; // Number of lines Number of lines of the area to be transferred. These bits can only be written when data transfers are disabled. Once the transfer has started, they are read-only.
    typedef bit_field_t<16, 0x3fff> NLR_PL; // Pixel per lines Number of pixels per lines of the area to be transferred. These bits can only be written when data transfers are disabled. Once the transfer has started, they are read-only. If any of the input image format is 4-bit per pixel, pixel per lines must be even.

    static constexpr uint32_t LWR_RESET_VALUE = 0x0; // Reset value
    typedef bit_field_t<0, 0xffff> LWR_LW; // Line watermark These bits allow to configure the line watermark for interrupt generation. An interrupt is raised when the last pixel of the watermarked line has been transferred. These bits can only be written when data transfers are disabled. Once the transfer has started, they are read-only.

    static constexpr uint32_t AMTCR_RESET_VALUE = 0x0; // Reset value
    static constexpr uint32_t AMTCR_EN = 0x1; // Enable Enables the dead time functionality.
    typedef bit_field_t<8, 0xff> AMTCR_DT; // Dead Time Dead time value in the AXI clock cycle inserted between two consecutive accesses on the AXI master port. These bits represent the minimum guaranteed number of cycles between two consecutive AXI accesses.
