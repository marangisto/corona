    volatile uint32_t PCR; // NAND Flash control registers
    volatile uint32_t SR; // This register contains information about the FIFO status and interrupt. The FMC features a FIFO that is used when writing to memories to transfer up to 16 words of data.This is used to quickly write to the FIFO and free the AXI bus for transactions to peripherals other than the FMC, while the FMC is draining its FIFO into the memory. One of these register bits indicates the status of the FIFO, for ECC purposes.The ECC is calculated while the data are written to the memory. To read the correct ECC, the software must consequently wait until the FIFO is empty.
    volatile uint32_t PMEM; // The FMC_PMEM read/write register contains the timing information for NAND Flash memory bank. This information is used to access either the common memory space of the NAND Flash for command, address write access and data read/write access.
    volatile uint32_t PATT; // The FMC_PATT read/write register contains the timing information for NAND Flash memory bank. It is used for 8-bit accesses to the attribute memory space of the NAND Flash for the last address write access if the timing must differ from that of previous accesses (for Ready/Busy management, refer to Section20.8.5: NAND Flash prewait feature).
    reserved_t<0x1> _0x90;
    volatile uint32_t ECCR; // This register contain the current error correction code value computed by the ECC computation modules of the FMC NAND controller. When the CPU reads/writes the data from a NAND Flash memory page at the correct address (refer to Section20.8.6: Computation of the error correction code (ECC) in NAND Flash memory), the data read/written from/to the NAND Flash memory are processed automatically by the ECC computation module. When X bytes have been read (according to the ECCPS field in the FMC_PCR registers), the CPU must read the computed ECC value from the FMC_ECC registers. It then verifies if these computed parity data are the same as the parity value recorded in the spare area, to determine whether a page is valid, and, to correct it otherwise. The FMC_ECCR register should be cleared after being read by setting the ECCEN bit to 0. To compute a new data block, the ECCEN bit must be set to 1.

    volatile uint32_t SDTR2; // This register contains the timing parameters of each SDRAM bank
    volatile uint32_t SDCMR; // This register contains the command issued when the SDRAM device is accessed. This register is used to initialize the SDRAM device, and to activate the Self-refresh and the Power-down modes. As soon as the MODE field is written, the command will be issued only to one or to both SDRAM banks according to CTB1 and CTB2 command bits. This register is the same for both SDRAM banks.
    volatile uint32_t SDRTR; // This register sets the refresh rate in number of SDCLK clock cycles between the refresh cycles by configuring the Refresh Timer Count value.Examplewhere 64 ms is the SDRAM refresh period.The refresh rate must be increased by 20 SDRAM clock cycles (as in the above example) to obtain a safe margin if an internal refresh request occurs when a read request has been accepted. It corresponds to a COUNT value of 0000111000000 (448). This 13-bit field is loaded into a timer which is decremented using the SDRAM clock. This timer generates a refresh pulse when zero is reached. The COUNT value must be set at least to 41 SDRAM clock cycles.As soon as the FMC_SDRTR register is programmed, the timer starts counting. If the value programmed in the register is 0, no refresh is carried out. This register must not be reprogrammed after the initialization procedure to avoid modifying the refresh rate.Each time a refresh pulse is generated, this 13-bit COUNT field is reloaded into the counter.If a memory access is in progress, the Auto-refresh request is delayed. However, if the memory access and Auto-refresh requests are generated simultaneously, the Auto-refresh takes precedence. If the memory access occurs during a refresh operation, the request is buffered to be processed when the refresh is complete.This register is common to SDRAM bank 1 and bank 2.

Note: The CCLKEN bit of the FMC_BCR2..4 registers is dont care. It is only enabled through the FMC_BCR1 register. Bank 1 must be configured in synchronous mode to generate the FMC_CLK continuous clock. If CCLKEN bit is set, the FMC_CLK clock ratio is specified by CLKDIV value in the FMC_BTR1 register. CLKDIV in FMC_BWTR1 is dont care. If the synchronous mode is used and CCLKEN bit is set, the synchronous memories connected to other banks than Bank 1 are clocked by the same clock (the CLKDIV value in the FMC_BTR2..4 and FMC_BWTR2..4 registers for other banks has no effect.)

The programmed bus turnaround delay is inserted between an asynchronous read (in muxed or mode D) or write transaction and any other asynchronous /synchronous read/write from/to a static bank. If a read operation is performed, the bank can be the same or a different one, whereas it must be different in case of write operation to the bank, except in muxed mode or mode D. In some cases, whatever the programmed BUSTRUN values, the bus turnaround delay is fixed as follows: The bus turnaround delay is not inserted between two consecutive asynchronous write transfers to the same static memory bank except in muxed mode and mode D. There is a bus turnaround delay of 1 FMC clock cycle between: Two consecutive asynchronous read transfers to the same static memory bank except for modes muxed and D.
