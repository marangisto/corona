This is the case when the data size is 8 bits and only one slot 0 is defined in NBSLOT[4:0] of SAI_xSLOTR register (NBSLOT[3:0] = 0000). In master mode, if the master clock (available on MCLK_x pin) is used, the frame length should be aligned with a number equal to a power of 2, ranging from 8 to 256. When the master clock is not used (NODIV = 1), it is recommended to program the frame length to an value ranging from 8 to 256.

The value set in this bitfield represents the number of slots + 1 in the audio frame (including the number of inactive slots). The maximum number of slots is 16. The number of slots should be even if FSDEF bit in the SAI_xFRCR register is set. The number of slots must be configured when the audio block is disabled. They are ignored in AC97 or SPDIF mode.
    typedef bit_field_t<16, 0xffff> SAI_ASLOTR_SLOTEN; // Slot enable. These bits are set and cleared by software. Each SLOTEN bit corresponds to a slot position from 0 to 15 (maximum 16 slots). The slot must be enabled when the audio block is disabled. They are ignored in AC97 or SPDIF mode.

When this bit is set, an interrupt is generated if the FREQ bit in the SAI_xSR register is set.

    static constexpr uint32_t SAI_AIM_CNRDYIE = 0x10; // Codec not ready interrupt enable (AC97). This bit is set and cleared by software. When the interrupt is enabled, the audio block detects in the slot 0 (tag0) of the AC97 frame if the Codec connected to this line is ready or not.
